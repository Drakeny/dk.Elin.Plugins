[h1]Only Lose Karma If Caught[/h1]

[b]Stealing(pickpocketing)[/b], [b]Harvesting[/b], [b]Lockpicking[/b], and [b]Dwarfing[/b](rock n stone) does not reduce karma unless you are caught in the act.

[h2]Toggle Individual Behaviour[/h2]

All patches are enabled by default, the detection radius is 4 tiles, the same as Elin game code.
You may change the setting in `Elin\BepInEx\config\dk.elinplugins.karmaoncaught.cfg` to toggle individual patch.

[h2]Chance of Getting Caught[/h2]

The chance of getting caught depends on the number of possible witnesses in the detection range, whether they have you on line of sight, and the corresponding skill for the action.
