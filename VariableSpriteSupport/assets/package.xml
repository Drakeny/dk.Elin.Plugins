[h1]Variable Sprite Support (formerly High Res Sprite Fix)[/h1]

Allows the usage of variable resolutions and ratios of PCC sprites and accordingly fit them onto the PCC.

[h1]Parts[/h1]

[img=https://i.postimg.cc/Y9YcFhnf/demo.jpg]

Mod authors can now create PCC parts with sprites other than 32x48.

[h1]Body[/h1]

Body asset must be in the ratio of 2:3 still, the resolution doesn't matter.

[h1]Credits[/h1]
Mirkhan for the idea and help with testing.
noa for not setting all textures on GPU side so I don't have to copy & blit
