[h1]Variable Sprite Support (formerly High Res Sprite Fix)[/h1]

Allows the usage of variable resolutions and ratios of PCC sprites and accordingly fit them onto the PCC.

[h1]Parts[/h1]

Mod authors can now create PCC parts with sprites other than 32x48.

[h1]Body[/h1]

Body sprite still needs to be in the ratio of 2:3, but the resolution doesn't matter. You can use a large canvas if that helps.

[h1]Credits[/h1]

Mirkhan for the idea and help with testing.
noa for not setting all textures on GPU side so I don't have to copy and blit
