  <description>[h2]Equipment Comparison[/h2]

When viewing unequipped items, display comparison information for items already equipped in the same slot. When viewing
a pet's inventory, it will also compare the pet's equipment.

[h2]Toggle[/h2]

To toggle the comparison functionality, press [b](Left)Shift + C[/b]  
Keybindings can be changed in `Elin/BepInEx/config/dk.elinplugins.equipmentcomparison.cfg` 

[h2]!!Caution!![/h2]

If UI scale is set to > 140%, tooltips will look funny.


[b]1.4[/b] Fixed the overlapping bug when the tooltip was first time drawn to the right.
[b]1.3[/b] Fixed a bug where items in public containers with no owner cannot be compared with player.
[b]1.2[/b] Updated keybinding for toggling comparison functionality.
[b]1.1[/b] Updated the alignment for multiple tooltips at the same time, instead of overlapping vertically, they'll stack horizontally.
