# High Res Sprite Fix

Allows the usage of high resolution assets for PCC without enlarging the sprite in game.

The sprite itself still needs to be in the ratio of 2:3 (akin to 32x48).

Makes modder's life easier BUT it may still look pixelated in game.

It was really just a bool value change. And likely to be turned on by noa themself.

What is even the point of this all.
