it derives from **AI_Dance** act, and will play doodle dance music on use.

The ability will be added to player on load if they don't have it yet.

The C# DLL source code is placed in **/src** directory. 

**Important** To compile it, you need to set environment variable **ElinGamePath** to the path of your Elin game install folder.

The source sheet is placed in each language folder in **/LangMod** folder.
