  [h1]Animated Custom Sprites[/h1]

Allows the usage of animated sprites for [b]custom[/b] characters and items.

To create [b]custom[/b] characters and items, you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3370512305]Custom Whatever Loader[/url] to simplify the process.

[h2]Animation Clip[/h2]

To create a clip, simply name each frame with `id_acs_name#interval_index`.

For example, a custom character with id `boxchicken`, you should prepare the following sprites in the [b]Texture[/b] folder:

[list]
[*] `boxchicken.png`, base sprite, that gets loaded as a still image, used everywhere in the game.

[*] `boxchicken_acs_idle#66_1.png`, 1st frame of clip "idle", which is used when card is **idling**, with an interval of 66ms.
[*] repeat and follow the same convention to create frames for clip "idle".

[*] `boxchicken_acs_combat#66_1.png`, 1st frame of clip "combat", which is used when card is **in combat**, with an interval of 66ms.
[*] repeat and follow the same convention to create frames for clip "combat".

[*] Note that combat clip is [b]not required[/b].

[*] `boxchicken_acs_customClipName#66_0.png`, 1st frame of clip "customClipName", this clip needs to be played manually by using Animated Custom Sprites API. 
[*] repeat and follow the same convention to create frames for clip "customClipName"...
[/list]

[h2]API[/h2]

By referencing AnimatedCustomSprites.dll, you can access the entire `ACS.API` namespace, with the following extension methods:
[code]
// clip control
card.StartAcsClip(clipName)
card.StartAcsClip(clipType)
card.StopAcsClip()

// clip access
card.GetAcsClip(clipName)
card.GetAcsClip(clipType)
card.GetAcsClips(clipName)
card.GetAcsClips(clipType)
card.GetAllAcsClips()

// clip creation
card.CreateAcsClip(sprites[], clipName, clipType, interval)
card.CreateAcsClips(sprites[])
[/code]
